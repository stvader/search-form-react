### `Using environtment variables`


### `Timezones`

Info of timezones and time isn't clear. I need real API for understanding clearly this point. From API description I understand that response consists times in user's timezone, in thay case app should have the easy solution and ui doesn't need a timezone. If there is time in UTC format I can transform it to timezone of user. If there is another view of time, plaese give me example of respose.
